# TAQOS

TAQOS is an open-source technology agnostic quantum operating system, aimed at
providing a plug-n-play operating system for quantum computation and quantum
information experiments. The system consists of abstracted quantum computing
modules which use specific drivers and hardware implementations to run
experiments.

## How to Get Started

If you are on a Linux or Mac, run the following command in the project's root 
directory to setup TAQOS manually:

```
sh setup
```

## Goals and Timeline

The following is a rough guideline for desired deliverables.

1. August 2017 - Basic Operating System Infrastructure
2. 

## Technology Stack

Most of the system infrastructure is written in Python; the decision to use
Python was decided due to the fact that it can be run on most host operating
systems, is easy to read, and most of the desired contributors (i.e. students
and professors in labratory settings) are familiar with the language.

## How to Contribute

We are actively looking for people to help build the system, especially with
respect to integrating specific hardware devices into the operating system.
Feel free to log issues, open PRs for fixes or additions, and communicate
with us using the dedicated Slack team.
