# TAQOS Style Guidelines

TAQOS is a fine-tuned piece of machinery, and we ensure that by maintaining a
high quality codebase. The following is a list of styling guidelines that we
like to look for, which help maintain readability and extendability. These
styles refer to both aesthetic styles and coding techniques.

## Functional Guidelines

These guidelines refer to the techniques and methodologies used in the actual
programming of TAQOS.

1. **> 85% test coverage** - All code within the releases and master branch of 
TAQOS must have at least 85% test coverage. Seperate branches and forks of TAQOS may
certainly have less coverage, but this invariant must be preserved when merging
any PRs into the central parts of this project.

2. **Excellent documentation** - All methods, classes, and global veriables
must be well-documented, subject to the discretion of the code reviewer during
the PR code review process. Realize that many of the contributors to this
project are not necessarily from a coding background, and so make sure to
explain pieces of code that are not entirely straightforward.

## Style Guidelines

These guidelines refer to the aesthetic qualities of code within TAQOS.

1. **80 column limit** - No characters may exceed column 80 in ANY file,
whether it be Python, .md's, etc... The ONLY exception to this is when
doing so would ruin the functionality of a piece of code.

More coming soon!
